# TickTock

This project was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1 as a way to set an alarm for yourself.  Good use is in a pomodoro application or just
when you're trying to not waste so much time on Facebook :)

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

### TODO
- have user input a message that appears on the screen during their alarm
- change background color according to the time of day
- clean up timepicker modal - perhaps use a different style, don't much like the way it came pre-packaged
