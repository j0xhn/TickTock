# TickTock

This project was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1 as a way to set an alarm for yourself.  Good use is if you're following a pomodoro-type work schedule, or 
when you're trying to not waste too much time on Facebook :)

## Build & development

Fork or clone this repo and run `npm install && bower install` then run `grunt serve` for viewing locally and `grunt build` for building dist.

### TODO
- have user input a message that appears on the screen during their alarm
- change background color according to the time of day (slight gradient from night dark indigo, to day blue, sunset orange back to indigo night)
- clean up timepicker modal and drop standard bootstrap inputs, buttons, etc.. -- perhaps use a different way all together -- would need to talk to users and others about how they like to interact 
with time pickers.
